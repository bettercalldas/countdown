# Countdown

## Description

Countdown is a command line program that lets you know how many days are
remaining until any number of events that you've configured. Use it in your
shell's $PS2 to always have the soonest event displayed, or just use it on the
fly whenever you need some encouragement for the week.

```toml
[[events]]
name = "summer break"
time = 1892160000 # these are unix timestamps in seconds

[[events]]
name = "wwdc"
time = 1892250000

[[events]]
name = "memorial day weekend"
time = 1892170000
```

3. Now run `countdown` in your shell and you're all set ðŸŽ‰
